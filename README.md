# Analysing What Drives Value Up for a Football Player

Setting out to play football professionally maybe an easy decision to take, but actually becoming a football professional that gets paid a good amount at a good club is a whole different story.

Knowing many who dream to be  professional footballers, I set out to see what aspects of being a footballer is valued most in the world's  market of professional footballers.

Here's what I found out:

**--> Investing time in improving your acceleration and sprint speed may not be worthwhile as both show steady declines as one's age increases. Furthermore, your value as a player regarding this will only increase when these attributes are over a minimum of 90 in Europe only.**

**--> Reactions do not slow down but speed up as age increases, this may be due to enhanced intuition of the game accummulated and developed from playing many football games.**

**-->Having good reaction times, ball control, finishing and vision on the pitch leads to the earliest rise in a player's value. Furthermore, honing these skills to the highest possible level leads to a longer time period of a player being highly valued.**
* To explore the relationship between reactions times and the monetary value a player is assigned further, I developed a linear regression model that was able to correlate between value and reactions times with an accuracy of nearly **70%**, which is significant.

**--> A player's dribbling must be at least at a level of 80 or above to have any significant impact on their value in the market**

**--> Having very good stamina, heading ability, agility, jumping and strength doesn't do much for a player's value.**
* The aspect of stamina is well backed with the following violin plot which shows that nearly all continents have a similar distribution of stamina, however, players in North America seem to be slightly unfit with a less pronounced hump in the middle of the plot.
